<h1>About <span> Me</span></h1>
<h3>Hello, I'm Okoh Blessing</h3>
<p> Sequel to bagging a Hons degree in Petroleum and Gas Engineering, I delved into the world of programming; since then, I've never looked back. I'm a web developer equipped with knowledge of Html, CSS, and javaScript. 
  <p>For me, developing responsive, user-friendly, and highly-functional websites isn't just a means of livelihood. The challenge, opportunity to explore a vast reservoir of knowledge, and watching myself create unique designs makes the entire experience exhilarating.
I have had the privilege of designing many user interfaces across a vast range of industries. </p>
 <p> I am also a HubSpot and Google certified content marketer with over five years of experience in article writing, B2B and B2C writing, blogging, proofreading, editing, critiquing, and Search Engine Optimization.</p>
  
<p> When I'm not developing web pages or creating content, I spend my time baking delicious cakes and pastries.

<h1>TRYING TO CHOOSE A SUITABLE WEBSITE FOR YOUR BRAND? 
</h1>
</a>
<span class="date"> Oct 20, 2020 </span>
<br>
<span class="date"> By Blessing Okoh </span>



  
  <p>Here is a list of some of the most popular types of websites and their purposes. This listicle will guide you in making the right choice for your businesses/brands/companies.
  <br>
  <br> 
  <b>Brochure website </b>
  <br>
  If your objective is to provide information about your company, clients, contact info, and testimonials, then a brochure website should be a go-to.
 </p>
  <br>
  
  <span class="moreText">

  <b>E-commerce</b>
  <br>
  If your business centers on the sales of products and services, then an E-commerce site is what you need. Features such as a login portal and payment gateway are highly recommended.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Lead generation website</b>
  <br>
  A lead generation website is appropriate if you aim to engage and educate your target audience and, subsequently, find suitable prospects interested in purchasing your goods or patronizing your services.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>E-Booking</b>
  <br>
  An E-booking website is suitable for hotels, restaurants, travel and tour agencies, etc. A platform is provided for users to book tickets and reservations online.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Portfolio Website</b>
  <br>
  A portfolio website provides an online platform for professionals to showcase their works. Photographers, web developers, interior decorators, and other service providers can have portfolio sites. They are usually concise and captivating.
   <br>
   <br>
  <b>Personal Websites.</b>
  <br>
  Express your thoughts, opinions, ideologies, experiences, and lifestyle via a personal blog, vlog, or photo diary.

<h1>8 STEPS TO TAKE WHEN RECOVERING A HACKED WEBSITE </h1>
</a>
<span class="date"> Oct 23, 2020 </span>
<br>
<span class="date"> By Blessing Okoh </span>

<p>
If you have ever been hacked, you will understand how utterly frustrating it can be. Devoting time, effort, and resources into creating a site only to have it hijacked right under your nose isn’t a palatable experience. Not only will you lose access to your site, but you also stand a chance of losing credibility as some confidential information may be compromised.
  If you find yourself in such position, do not panic.</p>
  <br>
  <span class= "moreText">
 
<b>Notify your host</b>
 <br>
 A host accommodates every web page on the internet. First, inform the company hosting your site. Hacking is a daily occurrence in the online world, so your host has probably come across numerous scenarios like yours. They will be in an excellent position to advise you on the necessary steps to recover backups and possibly, the entire site.
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>Go offline</b>
 <br>
 Next, you should isolate your site entirely by taking it offline. This action will prevent further exposure, and also save your users from exposure to the hackers and whatever skewed data, codes, spams, and malicious wares they may have uploaded.
 <br>
 <br>
 You can do this by pointing your site’s DNS entries to a static page on another server that utilizes a 503 HTTP responsive code.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>Review user Accounts</b>
 <br>
 If you are operating a website with provisions for user account and data, ensure you carry out a thorough investigation to help determine the extent to which users’ information may have been compromised. 
 <br>
 <br>
 Also, note that most hackers may have accessed your website via a user account. So look out for failed login attempts and other suspicious activities. Investigating may also serve the purpose of locating entry accounts.
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>Locate Vulnerability</b>
 <br>Carry out extensive research to identify the weak ends of your site. For hackers to gain access into your websites, some vulnerabilities are exploited. They are a vast range of them. You can start by looking out for:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Weak or over-used passwords.</li>
<li>Bad coding practices.</li>
 <li>Outdated plugins (CMS sites like WordPress, Joomla).</li>
 </ul>
<br>
<br>
 
<b>Check the extent of the damage</b>
 <br>
 Before carrying out a cleanup, ensure you investigate the severity of the hacking. To do this, locate message center and security issues on the console in your browser and look out for messages you may have received from google informing you about spam or malware. Information about the nature of hack you have experienced will be provided under security issues.
 
 <br>
 <br>
 Also, take a good look at every page on your site to determine if the hackers have altered some content. You can compare this with your site-back up from an earlier date.
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>Clean and maintain your site/server</b>
 <br>
 After locating all the problems that may have exposed your site to attacks, the next best thing would be to carry out a significant cleanup. You can start by restoring your backup from an earlier date (before the site was hacked).
 <br>
 <br>
 <ul>
 <li>Change old passwords.</li>
 <li>Updates all software and plugins. If you run a CMS, install the latest version with limited plugins.</li>
<li>Inspect your codes and remove all forms of permissible or malicious codes.</li>
 <li>Remove URLs created by the hacker. </li>
 </ul>
 <br>
 <br>

 <b>Monitor your site</b>
 <br>
 At this point, take out time to observe your site; this will help determine if your fixes were effective.
 <br>
 <br>

 <b>Initiate proactive measures	</b>
<br>
Finally, just because your site has been hacked once doesn’t mean it cannot be hacked again. It is advisable that you carry out extensive research on preventive measures and implement them immediately.</p>

<h1>4 BENEFITS OF HAVING A WEBSITE </h1>
</a>
<span class="date"> Oct 26, 2020 </span>
<br>
<span class="date"> By Blessing Okoh </span>

<p>
Have you been running a business or personal brand for over a year? Then I guess the time is right for you to take a bold step of commitment by securing a website. 
<br>
<br>
Surprisingly, many business owners have no idea why they need a website. Not to sound patronizing, but you would be amazed by the numerous benefits a website holds for you and your brand.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<span class="moreText">
<b>CREDIBILITY</b>
<br>
 It establishes credibility and improves your business image, especially in modern society, where many businesses have no offices or fixed address. It also shows commitment to the long-term success of your business. An individual or organization with no intention of building a long-term business would never want to go through the complexities of acquiring a website.
  <br>
  <br>
<b>IMPROVED MARKETING</b>
  <br>
Your website is a robust marketing tool.  When rightly used, it can help you gain a tremendous advantage over your competitors. Adding your web address to promotional materials and social media pages can boost your online presence by encouraging your audience to visit your site for more information, improving leads, prospects, and conversion.
<br>
<br>
  
  
<b>REACH </b>
<br>
A website helps you target a broader audience/market. A vast range of individuals widely use search engines. Social media pages are cool, but not everyone has a Twitter or IG account. But we can all agree that a more significant percentage of the world population visits search engines like Google daily.
<br>
<br>
 Imagine having a Search Engine Optimized site readily available on the web for viewers to see. All you need is to put in the right work to push your web page up on search lists, and whenever anyone looks up info related to the services or content you provide, your page automatically pops up.
<br>
<br>
<b>UNLIMITED ACCESS</b>
<br>
A website provides 24-7 accessibility to clients. You do not have to be online to provide your clients necessary information or assist with sales of products (such as on an E-commerce site). 
<br>
<br>
Websites saves you the stress of explaining or attending to the individual customer since all necessary information is available on your site. 
<br>
<br>
You can also improve productivity by selling your products directly to your clients via your website.</p>
  <br>
 <br> Keep in mind that these are a few amongst many other benefits of having a website. So what are you waiting for? Invest in one today!
